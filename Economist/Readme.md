## Economist graphic repair

This plot is a stab at fixing an egregiously bad plot from <i>The Economist</i>. This happens surprisingly often for a newspaper with such a great reputation.

The plot is built up over time by re-using previous chunks (pass1, pass2, etc.), instead of copying code from previous chunks, which can be tedious.
